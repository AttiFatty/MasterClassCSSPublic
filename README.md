# MasterClassCss
My Personal Repository of All My Necessary CSS shortcuts 
In this Repository I am going to store a "MasterClass.css" file that will contain most or all of the basic yet important css modifiers I use often. I intend to use my own basic abbreviation for each function so that they can be stacked.
